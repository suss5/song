/*
Where are those
 dark lonely days
Where has
 my old self gone
How to be selfish
 now we are two of a kind
How to focus
 when you're always on my mind

Ohh darling,
 I have one request
Lovely sweetheart
 make me love you less

Do what you need to
Lie, break my heart
So I can take you for granted
Like I did at the start
